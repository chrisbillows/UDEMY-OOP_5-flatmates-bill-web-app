# Flatmates Bill Web App    

A basic web app made in Flask.

The app allows two flatmates to apportion utility bills based on days spent in the flat during a billing period.

E.g. Electric bill for February = Â£100

Flatmate 1 was resident for 28 days.

Flatmate 2 was only resident for 11 days.

BUT WHO PAYS WHAT!?  Friends! Don't fight! 

The flatmates bill app is here to save you!
